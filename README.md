### Key Points:
1. **Objective:** Predict energy consumption by type for hydraulic fracturing with scarce data.
2. **Methods Used:** 
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - CatBoost regression model
   - Uncertainty modeling through data augmentation
3. **Learnings:** 
   - Optimizing workflows for categorical datasets
   - Understanding hydraulic fracturing energy requirements

## Workflow Overview

### Workflow Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning & Imputation**: Handle missing values and standardize the dataset.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most relevant features for prediction.
3. **Model Building**: Implement machine learning models, including CatBoost.
